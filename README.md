# BountyHunter

"Every great wizard in history had started out as nothing more than we are now: students. If they can do it, why not us?"

Create Bounties for the students studying to be the engineers, designers, creators, and the next generation of witches and wizards to reward them for answering ur questions and completing ur tasks!

Sponsors: create Bounties to get ur QUESTIONS ANSWERED, ur TASKS DONE, and ur PROBLEMS SOLVED

Responders: win EDU tokens for creating the best Response to a Bounty

Voters: bet on the best Responses to win EDU tokens while helping maintain quality of Responses

Students: earn FREE EDU token DIVIDENDS every month


Anyone can participate by sponsoring a Bounty, leaving a Response, or Voting on others' responses
Sponsors get access to a network of .edu students to answer their questions, complete their tasks, and solve their problems 
Students who r helpful (ie leave 2 or more winning responses per month) receive FREE EDU token dividends at the end of the month at a fixed 2% annual inflation rate in addition to their Bounty Rewards

Bounties can be for anything: from writing an article to creating a powerpoint presentation to designing a Hyperloop Pod to Reinventing the Toilet to decentralized hackathons to solving the next set of Millenium Problems (the current set has a $1 million prize reward on web2 for each problem) to anything u can think of really

Let the hunt begin, Bounty Hunters!
